# Peer2peer-videochat #

**Peer2peer chat** is a one2one (person to person) webcam video chat using php/MySQL for meeting connection.
It is similar to google video chat service.

Once 2 persons are invited for a private chat, peer2peeer-chat connects them through RTMPF for a real time, peer2peer webcam video chat.

There is no Red5 or Flash Media Server RTMP server used so it can be installed on any shared hosting with simple php and MySQL.
